                     CRAWL IF THERE’S SMOKE
If you get caught in smoke, get down and crawl,taking short breaths through the nose. Cleaner, cooler air will be near the floor. Get Low – And Go.

FEEL THE DOORS BEFORE OPENING.
Before opening any doors, feel the door knob. If it is hot, don’t open the door. If it is cool, open it slightly, and if heat or heavy smoke are present, close the door and stay in the room.

GO TO THE NEAREST EXIT OR STAIRWELL.
If the nearest exit is blocked by fire, heat or smoke, go to another exit. Always use an exit stairwell, not an elevator. Elevator shafts may fill with smoke or the power may fail, leaving you trapped. Stairwell fire doors will keep out fire and smoke-if they are closed-and will protect you until you get outside.

                    Yes! Faculty, staff and students are required to immediately evacuate the building when a fire alarm sounds. Never assume a fire alarm activation indicates a false alarm. Always assume that the situation is a real threat.

                     Evacuation maps are posted throughout all CRC buildings. All smaller dormitories have written evacuation plans that are posted adjacent to the evacuation maps. Designated meeting points for each residence are noted on the posted plans. Many larger buildings have specific emergency evacuation plans identifying designated gathering points during an evacuation. Residence Assistants, Supervisors and Faculty can provide you the location of the designated meeting point for your building. If you are in doubt of your building’s specific gathering point, remember to proceed away from the building. Failure to move away from the building could result in personal injury or hindrance of emergency responders’ efforts.

The University takes every precaution possible to prevent fires. The Office of the Facilities Management and Planning (OFMP)’s Area Managers conduct monthly life safety inspections of the buildings in their area. EHS, in coordination with the Boston and Brookline Fire Departments, conducts annual inspections of all dormitories and quarterly inspections of assembly areas throughout campus. Periodic inspections of CRC buildings are conducted internally. In addition, building fire suppression and fire alarm systems are tested regularly to ensure they are in good working order.

                    Most buildings at Boston University are equipped with fire alarm and automatic sprinkler systems. These systems will activate when a fire produces enough smoke or heat to trigger them. Fire extinguishers are available for use by trained personnel. Several buildings are also equpiped with standpipe systems for fire department use.

A review of campus fires during the year’s 2000-2003 indicates that electrical failures are the most common cause of fires on campus, closely followed by unattended candles in dorm rooms and malfunctioning equipment. Other causes of fires during the same time frame include unattended Bunsen burners, unattended cooking, careless cigarette disposal, contractor accidents, and arson.

                    As stated in the Boston University Life Book “A student who, without reasonable cause, activates a fire alarm system or tampers with fire safety equipment, should expect to be expelled from the residential system and be referred to the Office of Judicial Affairs for further action (possibly including imposition of fines and suspension from the University); these cases may also be referred for criminal prosecution.”
